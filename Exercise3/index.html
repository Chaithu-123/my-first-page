                <h2>Snooker</h2>
                <p><strong>The origin of snooker dates back to the latter half of the 19th century.[7] In the 1870s, billiards was a popular activity amongst British Army officers stationed in India and several variations of the game were devised during this time.
                    One such variation originated at the officers' mess of the 11th Devonshire Regiment in 1875,[8] which combined the rules of two pocket billiards games, pyramid and life pool. The former was played with fifteen red balls and one black
                    positioned in a triangle, while the latter involved the potting of designated coloured balls.</strong></p>

                <h3>Pool Table</h3>
                <p> Pro player David Alcaide at the World Pool Masters 2007 Pool is a cue sport played on a table with six pockets along the rails, into which balls are deposited. Some of the more well known variants of pool include eight-ball, blackball,
                    nine-ball, ten-ball, seven-ball, straight pool, one-pocket, and bank pool. There are also hybrid games combining aspects of both pool and carom billiards, such as American four-ball billiards, cowboy pool, and bottle pool.</p>

                <h3>French Table</h3>
                <p>A French Bar Billiards table is around 6 x 3 feet and is similar in construction to a small Billiards table. Instead of pockets, holes are sunk into the table; 5 in a row across the far end of the table and three set in a triangle pattern
                    in the rear half of the table. A skittle is set up on a spot roughly in the centre of the table. If there are 3 skittles, the other two are set up behind either side of the 100 hole in a triangular formation. The holes are the rear
                    are worth 10, 20, 30, 20 and 10 points respectively. The hole in the centre is worth 100 points and the holes to either side in the centre are worth 50 points each.</p>

                <h3>English Table</h3>
                <p> English billiards was originally called the winning and losing carambole game, folding in the names of three predecessor games, the winning game, the losing game and the carambole game (an early form of straight rail), that combined to
                    form it. This is called simply billiards in the United Kingdom, where it originated, and in many former British colonies such as Australia, is a cue sport for two players or teams. Two cue balls (originally both white, with one marked
                    e.g. with a black dot, but more recently one white, one yellow) and a red object ball are used.</p>
